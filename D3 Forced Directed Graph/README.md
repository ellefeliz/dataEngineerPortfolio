Name : forcedDirectedGraph.html
Description: Undirected Graph dataset of boardgames (board_games.csv) using D3 for graph visualization.
Components: 2 files are needed: board_games.csv, that contains the data and forcedDIrectedGraph.html to visualize it, as well as the library folder
The dataset for this question was inspired by a reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/9aphuw/a_network_visualization_of_the_board_game/) about visualizing boardgames as a network, where the author calculates the similarity between board games based on categories and game mechanics where the edge value between each board game (node) is the total weighted similarity index. This dataset includes a summary of the data.
